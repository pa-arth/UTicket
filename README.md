   - Created the seller listing screens

Zaviyan Tharwani (Release 25%, Overall 37%)

   - Created the buyer flow screens

Deviation:

   - Stripe API isn't completely integrated into the app yet, we are still
     debating how we want to implement the payment (API within the app or
     some sort of payment link)
   - Firestore is also not completely implemented because it costs some amount
     of money, so we're figuring out alternatives for storage
